ASSIGNMENT3

This project demonstrates the use of Stack and Queue data structures through practical tasks, challenge exercises, and theoretical reflections. The goal is to understand how stacks and queues operate in real-world scenarios, and why their behavior (LIFO vs FIFO) is important in applications like undo operations, service lines, and data management.

Stack Tasks

Practical 1: UR

Task: Push ["Class1", "Class2", "Class3"] and pop two elements.

Objective: Identify the top of the stack after popping.

Solution: Top element is "Class1".

Practical 2: Irembo

Task: Push ["Form1", "Form2", "Form3"] and pop all elements.

Objective: Determine which elements are left in the stack.

Solution: Stack is empty.

Challenge

Task: Push ["1","2","3","4"], pop 1, then push "5".

Objective: Identify the top element.

Solution: Top element is "5".

Reflection

Concept: Stack models recent activity well because it uses LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Example: Undo operations in text editors, browser history, or function call stacks.

Queue Tasks

Practical 1: Airtel

Task: 6 clients queue; after 2 are served, determine the front client.

Solution: Client3 is at the front.

Practical 2: Nyabugogo

Task: 8 buses queue; identify the last bus.

Solution: Bus8 is last.

Challenge

Scenario: Choosing between queue and stack for restaurant orders.

Analysis: Queue (FIFO) is best; ensures first orders are served first.

Reflection

Concept: FIFO (First In, First Out) matters for fairness, predictable workflow, and customer satisfaction in service businesses.
