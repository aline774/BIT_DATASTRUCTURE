Integers → Perform total, average, min, max on applicant scores.

Strings → Use f-strings to generate a summary report.

Booleans → Apply compound threshold condition for performance status.

Lists → Add, remove (with condition), sort, and display applicant names.

Arrays → Store fixed-size subset, compute sum, and compare with list.

Dictionaries → Update, delete, and compute total across records.
1. Integers

Generate integer values representing applicant scores.

Compute total, average, minimum, maximum values.

2. Strings

Create a formatted report using f-strings.

Example:

Total applicants recorded.

Average score summary.

3. Booleans

Apply a threshold condition to evaluate applicants.

Use a compound condition to check if performance is Above Standard or Below Standard.

4. Lists

Maintain a list of applicant names.

Perform:

Add new element.

Remove based on condition.

Sort and display list before & after modifications.

5. Arrays

Use Python's built-in array module to store a fixed-size numeric subset of scores.

Compute sum of the array and compare with the list version.

6. Dictionaries

Build a list of dictionaries containing fields:

id

name

value (applicant’s score)

Perform operations:

Update one record.

Delete another.

Compute total of all values
