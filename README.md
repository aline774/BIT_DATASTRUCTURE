ASSIGNMENT1

Integers → Perform total, average, min, max on applicant scores.

Strings → Use f-strings to generate a summary report.

Booleans → Apply compound threshold condition for performance status.

Lists → Add, remove (with condition), sort, and display applicant names.

Arrays → Store fixed-size subset, compute sum, and compare with list.

Dictionaries → Update, delete, and compute total across records.
1. Integers

Generate integer values representing applicant scores.

Compute total, average, minimum, maximum values.

2. Strings

Create a formatted report using f-strings.

Example:

Total applicants recorded.

Average score summary.

3. Booleans

Apply a threshold condition to evaluate applicants.

Use a compound condition to check if performance is Above Standard or Below Standard.

4. Lists

Maintain a list of applicant names.

Perform:

Add new element.

Remove based on condition.

Sort and display list before & after modifications.

5. Arrays

Use Python's built-in array module to store a fixed-size numeric subset of scores.

Compute sum of the array and compare with the list version.

6. Dictionaries

Build a list of dictionaries containing fields:

id

name

value (applicant’s score)

Perform operations:

Update one record.

Delete another.

Compute total of all values

ASSIGNMENT3
This project demonstrates the use of Stack and Queue data structures through practical tasks, challenge exercises, and theoretical reflections. The goal is to understand how stacks and queues operate in real-world scenarios, and why their behavior (LIFO vs FIFO) is important in applications like undo operations, service lines, and data management.

Stack Tasks
Practical 1: UR

Task: Push ["Class1", "Class2", "Class3"] and pop two elements.

Objective: Identify the top of the stack after popping.

Solution: Top element is "Class1".

Practical 2: Irembo

Task: Push ["Form1", "Form2", "Form3"] and pop all elements.

Objective: Determine which elements are left in the stack.

Solution: Stack is empty.

Challenge

Task: Push ["1","2","3","4"], pop 1, then push "5".

Objective: Identify the top element.

Solution: Top element is "5".

Reflection

Concept: Stack models recent activity well because it uses LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Example: Undo operations in text editors, browser history, or function call stacks.

Queue Tasks
Practical 1: Airtel

Task: 6 clients queue; after 2 are served, determine the front client.

Solution: Client3 is at the front.

Practical 2: Nyabugogo

Task: 8 buses queue; identify the last bus.

Solution: Bus8 is last.

Challenge

Scenario: Choosing between queue and stack for restaurant orders.

Analysis: Queue (FIFO) is best; ensures first orders are served first.

Reflection

Concept: FIFO (First In, First Out) matters for fairness, predictable workflow, and customer satisfaction in service businesses.
